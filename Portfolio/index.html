            <h2>I am Corné Napier, a Software Developer</h2>
            
            <p>Since as far back as I can recall, I've harbored a deep fascination with technology. Whether it was disassembling my Xbox controller to experiment with mods, repairing a malfunctioning PC, exploring game modifications, or even developing my own web browser and text-based game in C++, technology has always been a central passion of mine..</p>

            <p>My academic journey led me to study psychology at university, driven by a desire to better comprehend both myself and human nature. I've consistently found joy in unraveling the intricacies of how things function, analyzing social dynamics, deciphering the impacts of body language, and understanding the communication processes within the brain and body. It seems I've always been intrigued by the synergy between back-end processes and front-end experiences.</p>

            <p>In the past, I envied those with a natural aptitude for artistic creativity, as my own artistic abilities were limited to drawing stick figures and a less-than-stellar singing voice. However, upon writing my initial lines of code and embarking on small coding projects, I discovered that programming offers its own realm of creativity and artistry.</p>

            <p>What I find most fulfilling in my work is the inherent challenge and the continuous opportunity to acquire new knowledge. In the field of software development, I've found an abundance of both, which keeps me thoroughly engaged and enthusiastic about what I do.</p>

            <p>I'm presently engaged in a project that reflects my passion for game development as a hobby. Leveraging my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've opted to craft a browser-based game. Although it's a work in progress, I aim to integrate additional features like a start button, pause functionality, and additional levels to enrich the gaming experience.</p>
